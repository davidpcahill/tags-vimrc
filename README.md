My vimrc is probably better than yours. It will also handle many common and useful plugins and actions.

So enjoy!

**To install properly, run the following:**

 git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

 git clone https://github.com/TagWolf/tags-vimrc/.vimrc ~/.vim/tags-vimrc

 cp ~/.vim/tags-vimrc ~/.vimrc

* Then in vi/vim

 :PluginInstall

* Restart vim

Should be all set!
